    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>  Delicious homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce have never been easier.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (for 6 servings)</h2>
    <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>6 ounces tomata paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Pizza Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 and 1/4 cups all-pupose flour</li>
        <li>2 ounce envelopes pizza crust yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 and 1/3 cups very warm water (~125 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>


    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy!
